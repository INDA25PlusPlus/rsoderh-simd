I've implemented a 4x4 matrix multiplication library.

## Benchmarks

Each benchmark performs a single matrix multiplication operation a number of
million times. The benchmarks measure the time for that single matrix
multiplication.

| Benchmark | Average time | Confidence interval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SISD | 15.042 ns | 14.739 ns - 15.441 ns |
